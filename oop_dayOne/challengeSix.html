<!-- Challenge 6: Class with Conditional Logic Inside Method
✅ Goal: Create a BankAccount class that accepts owner and balance.

Add methods:

deposit(amount)

withdraw(amount) – only allow if balance is enough

getBalance() – logs current balance -->

<script>

    class BankAccount {
        constructor(owner, balance = 0) {
            this.owner = owner
            this.balance = balance
        }

        deposit(amount = 0) {
            this.balance += amount;
        }

        withdrow(amount = 0) {
            if (this.balance < amount) {
                console.log("Bank balance is not efficient");
                return;
            }
            else {
                this.balance -= amount;
            }
        }

        getBalance() {
            console.log(`This is you bank balance ${this.balance}`);
        }

    }

    let bank = new BankAccount();
    bank.deposit(1000);
    bank.deposit(300);
    bank.withdrow(800);
    bank.getBalance();
