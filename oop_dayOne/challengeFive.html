<!-- ⚡️ Challenge 5: Add Method Outside the Constructor
✅ Goal: Create a constructor function called Animal with properties name and type.
Then attach a method speak() outside the constructor using .prototype that logs:
"[name] is a [type] and it makes a sound!"

🧠 This teaches how memory is saved by sharing methods using prototype. -->


<script>

    function Animal(name = "abc", type = "xyz") {
        this.name = name
        this.type = type
    }

    let first = new Animal("rabbit", "xzzx");

    Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
        console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.type} and it makes a sound!`)
    }

    first.speak();
