Create a Student constructor that takes name and grade and has a method introduce() that logs:

<script>

    function Student(name = "avinash", grade = "b") {
        this.name = name;
        this.grade = grade;
        this.introduce = function () {
            console.log(`Hi, Iâ€™m ${this.name} and Iâ€™m in grade ${this.grade}`)
        }
